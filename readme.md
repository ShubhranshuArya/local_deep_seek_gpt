# üîÆ LocalDeepSeek - Local MultiModal Chat Assistant

Welcome to LocalDeepSeek, an advanced AI application that brings together the power of DeepSeek's language and vision models for local image generation and multimodal interactions. This project offers a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, allowing you to generate images from text, chat with AI about images, and even perform RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) on documents.

## ‚ú® Features

- **MultiModal Chat**: Have intelligent conversations about images
- **Deep GPT Chat**: Enhanced chat interface with "thinking" UI
- **Document RAG**: Upload PDFs and chat about their contents
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create stunning images from textual descriptions
- **Local Execution**: All features run locally on your machine
